# Test Plan for Laserfiche SharePoint Integration

## Objective
We wish to verify that changes made to the Laserfiche SharePoint Integration do not disrupt
existing functionality in the product. This Test Plan should be executed prior to each new
release, and no changes should be included in the release until they have been tested. As 
new functionality is added to the Integration, new tests should be added to the Test Plan
to ensure adequate coverage.
