How To Deploy Laserfiche Apps to SharePoint Sites

1. [Click here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219) to go to the SharePoint Admin Center or find the same link at [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role#about-the-sharepoint-administrator-role-in-microsoft-365). If you can't access this webpage, then you need to ask an Administrator for help.
1. In the navigation menu on the left, select the "More features" item.
1. Open "Apps".
1. Click Upload and select the solution file. If you don't have the solution file, then clone the [SharePoint Repo](https://github.com/Laserfiche/laserfiche-sharepoint-integration) and follow the instructions in the README.md for building the
solution.
1. In your SharePoint Site (Not the Admin Center), navigate to your
site’s App catalog by clicking on the "Site Contents" item in the
navigation bar on the left side of the page.
1. Open the "New" Dropdown menu by clicking on the "+" icon.
1. Add the App named “laserfiche-sharepoint-integration-client-side-solution” if it is present in the list of Apps you can add, or look for it in the SharePoint Store. 
1. Enable the app if you are asked to do so.
1. Return to your site. If you can see  the SharePoint integration app under the “Site Contents” tab, then you have successfully installed the app.
