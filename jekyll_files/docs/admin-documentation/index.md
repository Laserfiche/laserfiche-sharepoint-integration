# Laserfiche SharePoint Online Integration Administration Guide

The following guides detail how to add the Laserfiche SharePoint Online integration. By default, you must be a tenant administrator to install the integration. Installing the integration involves the following steps:
1. Adding the integration to your SharePoint organization.
1. Adding the integration to a SharePoint site.
1. Configuring authentication between the integration and your Laserfiche Cloud account.
1. Mapping SharePoint columns and content types to Laserfiche. 

## Important Security Notice

JavaScript code running in same domain/origin as your SharePoint tenant has access to the Laserfiche Integration security token. This token must be kept secure to avoid unauthorized access to Laserfiche systems. To this end, ensure that only trusted code is allowed to run in the same domain/origin.
