# Laserfiche SharePoint Integration Administration Guide

The following guides detail how to set up the Laserfiche/SharePoint integration. Unlike the user guides, the admin guides
may require you to hold certain privileges, such as the ability to edit a page on a SharePoint site. Each guide contains important
information to help you set up the integration. If you are setting up for the first time, we recommend starting at the top.

## Security Advisory

Do not load, configure, or serve untrusted code in the same domain/origin as your SharePoint tenant. This includes other integrations you add to your app catalog. Code in the same domain may read your Laserfiche access token.
