# Laserfiche SharePoint Integration Administration Guide

The following guides detail how to set up the Laserfiche/SharePoint integration. Unlike the user guides, the admin guides
may require you to hold certain privileges, such as the ability to edit a page on a SharePoint site. Each guide contains important
information to help you set up the integration. If you are setting up for the first time, we recommend starting at the top.

## Important Security Notice

JavaScript code running in same domain/origin as your SharePoint tenant has access to the Laserfiche Integration security token. This token must be kept secure to avoid unauthorized access to Laserfiche systems. To this end, ensure that only trusted code is allowed to run in the same domain/origin.
