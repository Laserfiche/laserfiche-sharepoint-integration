# Working with the Laserfiche SharePoint Integration

## Introduction

Laserfiche SharePoint Integration allows you to do two things:

- <b>Browse Laserfiche repository:</b> Sites in SharePoint can use the integration to add a web part which provides a view into the
Laserfiche cloud repository and to open documents in Laserfiche Web Client. The Repository Explorer web part supports this functionality.

- <b>Save documents to Laserfiche:</b> 
The integration enables users to export files and metadata directly from SharePoint to Laserfiche. The Laserfiche Sign In and Admin
Configuration web parts support this functionality.

## Guides
- The [Admin Guides](./docs/admin-documentation) explain how to set up the integration, and may require specialized permission.
- The [User Guides](./docs/user-documentation) explain how to use a page with an integration already set up to save documents or browse the Laserfiche repository.
